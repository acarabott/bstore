1 x Very sturdy desk. At least 4'6" by 3 foot. (Sturdy!)
1 x Mixing desk (Not Behringer please) - If you want to be sure Mackie 1604-VLZ3 fills the spec.
	- 4 Line inputs channels with EQ
	- MUST HAVE Either direct out on each channel or 4 aux channels
4 x Large Powered speakers e.g. Mackie SRM450
2 x Powered Speakers (can be smaller, e.g. SRM350);
6 x Speaker stands (to head height)
6 x Balanced 1/4" Jack to Jack cables (1 meter)
6 x Balanced 1/4" Jack to Jack/XLR (ASK THE PA COMPANY FOR SPEAKER INPUT TYPE, PROBABLY XLR) cables. I don't know the space, so can't specify length. They need to get from where I will be positioned, to the 4 corners of the main public room and 2 sides of the model's room (Be safe, order LONG).

I don't know the power socket situation in the room, but in the worst case scenario (only 1-2 outlets) will need

2 x 4 way extensions near desk
1 x Kettle lead for mixing desk

###########################################
4 x LONG kettle leads for powered speakers 
OR
4 x normal kettle leads
4 x LONG single socket power extensions (for speakers)
1 x 4 way extension
Again, use your judgement of room size
